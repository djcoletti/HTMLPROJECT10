	<li>	<p style="color:royalblue;font-family:arial;font-size:150%;"> Durham House of Pets delivery policies are easily accessible for the public. We provide in person delivery for free and online services for items that we sell. We primarily ship through UPS as we offer our products and services up to 40 states. Our focus for delivery runs through obtainable procedures regarding the quantity of items sold and the price of the products. The delivery process involves a timeframe of 5-10 days once the item is bought. Although, deliveries can be quicker depending on the quantity and price of the products. If the quantity of items bought is at a low price, then the delivery procedure will be faster and if the quantity of items and price is higher then the procedure will take more time. We will guarantee that the products you purchase will always go to the correct address and not be mishandled. </p> </li>

A valid receipt must be shown to Durham House of Pets regarding a price that is valued at $15 or more.
