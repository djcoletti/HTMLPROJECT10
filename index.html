<p style="color:royalblue;font-family:arial;font-size:150%;"> Durham House of Pets was founded by Alexzander Simmons on October 10th, 1982 in Miami, Florida. DHP is a retail organization producing an infinite number of pet products and services over a wide variety of animals. We offer dog, cat, bird, reptile, and fish products along with hamsters and guinea pigs. When Durham House of Pets was first established the products sold included supplies and apparel for dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, and fish. Over the years DHP has grown immensely with the production of charities, nursery/adoption centers and the expansion of store locations throughout the United States. </p>
